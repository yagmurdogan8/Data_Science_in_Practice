Situation in Haiti - Over the weekend, gang leader Jimmy Chérizier (alias Barbecue) posted a video addressing Prime Minister, Garry Conille, offering to keep his gang off the streets and stay in their base in exchange for dialogue to resolve the security crisis. - Conille responded to the above that a dialogue would be possible, after weapons were surrendered and the authority of the Haitian state was recognised. - Earlier, Chérizier posted a video claiming that political and economic elites in the country had been training and equipping gang members in working-class neighbourhoods. He further stated that there would be terror in Delmas if the police did not stop targeting him. - Rameau Normil has been reappointed as the Acting Director General of the Haitian National Police (PNH). Previously appointed in 2019 for the same role, he was dismissed in 2020 for lack of results.
