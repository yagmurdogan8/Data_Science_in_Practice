"Haiti Situation Report 3, 7 February 2024",https://www.eepa.be/?p=8086,"Demonstrations and violent clashes have been taking place all over Haiti’s capital region in the past days in the runup to the deadline of 7 February imposed by demonstrators to demand Prime Minister Ariel Henry to leave office.
Guy Philippe, a former Haitian senator who has recently been instigating civil disobedience, was among demonstrators in Pétion-Ville, fulfilling his promise that he would be back in Port-au-Prince before 7 February.
Clashes with the police in the context of the demonstrations have led to two deaths in Port-au-Prince and other regions in Haiti, such as Cap Haitien.
The demonstrators are primarily supporters of Guy Philippe, the Ptit Dessalines Party, led by Jean-Charles Moïse, and agents from the Protected Areas Security Brigade (BSAP).
Demonstrators in Ouanaminthe made an attempt to burn down a market on Tuesday 23 January.
Truck drivers and the general population have been called to strike in protest of the insecurity on national roads. The strikes are primarily organised by the Anti-Corruption Trade Union Brigade (BSAC).
The blockades on the roads by armed groups will likely create a fuel shortage in Port-au-Prince, leading to a steep increase in fuel prices, according to the trade unionist Jacques Anderson Décroches.
Armed groups have taken control of several neighbourhoods in Carrefour in Port-au-Prince. The areas of Martissant, Mariani, Carrefour feuilles, Pernier, Croix des Bouquets, Bel-Air and communes of Artibonite are all under gang control.
Armed men attacked several neighbourhoods of Carrefour on 5 February, trying to take control of the area. Several residents were killed and many were displaced.
The unrest in the country has led to the closure of schools in several regions, while health institutions are struggling to function and blockades on principal roads are inhibiting circulation.
The director of the National Agency for Protected Areas (ANAP), Jeantel Joseph, was dismissed by the Haitian government. A commission consisting of 5 members, including members of the Haitian National Police (PNH) and of the Haitian Armed forces (FADH), will replace him.
The Haitian government ordered all those working with ANAP to be registered at the Ministry of the Environment. These ANAP agents will no longer be allowed to circulate in towns or cities, having been deemed too powerful and responsible for violent clashes with the police.
The head of the Protected Areas Security Brigade (BSAP), an operational directorate of ANAP, Joseph Jean Baptiste, has accused the government of adding fuel to the fire. In protest, Baptiste roamed on the street with armed agents.
Agents of the BSAP have been accused of shootings against the Town Hall of Mirebalais. In other parts of the capital city, BSAP agents have complied with the new regulations.
213 homicide cases, 69 kidnappings, and dozens of rape cases have been reported in Port-au-Prince since the start of the year. 52 people were killed in armed attacks on 30 and 31 January.

Situation on the Multinational Security Support (MSS)
The Kenyan High court ruled that the deployment of police officers outside of the country is unconstitutional, unless a reciprocal agreement has been made with the host government, which was not deemed to be the case for the MSS. The Kenyan government plans on appealing the ruling.
Despite the court ruling, the Kenyan government has assured that it is still committed to leading the mission in Haiti, which could possibly already take place in the first half of February, if an agreement is made with the Haitian government.
The Kenyan Prime Cabinet Secretary, Musalia Mudavadi, held talks in Washington DC with US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, discussing the MSS among other topics. Both parties stated they are still devoted to continuing the plans to improve the lives of the Haitian people.
International situation
The European Union pledged €3 million to a basket fund for the Haitian National Police (PNH). The EU’s contribution will in part be used to better regulate the influx of illegal goods into the country.
Parts of the funds provided by the EU will go directly to the PNH, where it will be used to fight sexual crimes and increase the presence of female officers within the institution."
"Haiti Situation Report 2, 23 January 2024",https://www.eepa.be/?p=8082,"The violence in Port-au-Prince and surrounding departments has escalated in the past month, with numerous reports of kidnappings and bodies found in the city, as well as an escalation of violence and demonstrations against the government.
The Haitian National Police Force (PNH) deployed several specialised units on 15 January in Mariani, with the aim of facilitating the circulation of peaceful citizens. The situation there has been tense for 2 months since gangs took control of the area on 1 November 2023.
The clashes between the police force and armed groups in Mariani have blocked transport of goods through the National Road #2. This has resulted in a drastic price inflation of basic goods in the capital, and an inflation of imported goods in several (southern) regions.
Heavy fire was reported from the neighbourhoods of La Saline, Alerte street, the Bel’air district, Laraque street, Muller avenue and Maya street in Port-au-Prince on 14 January.
On 18 January heavy fighting was seen in the neighbourhood of Solino, under attack by the Bel-Air and Kempes gangs, who also set houses on fire. The police forces have not yet intervened in the situation. The two gangs want to take control of the area to serve as transit for kidnappings.
Former senator Guy Philippe has called on his supporters to civil disobedience, leading to protests in several cities in the country since 15 January. The demonstrations have led to a number of casualties, along with the closure of schools, banks and public offices.
The demonstrators demand that the Prime Minister Ariel Henri steps down by 7 February 2023, while Guy Philippe is advocating for an armed revolt.
Guy Philippe has been summoned to the prosecutor’s office after farmer’s filed a complaint against him for destruction of property, fire, assault, criminal conspiracy and illegal possession of automatic weapons.
A high ranking government official has stated that the Provisional Electoral Council will be formed in 2024 together with the reform of the Constitution and the organisation of elections.
250 executives within the Haitian banking sector have left the sector and the country in 2023, leading to a skills drain. The movement of people out of Haiti due to insecurity has been draining the country of qualified professionals.
Over 1,800 police officers left Haiti in 2023, according to the national union of Haitian police. The principal drivers behind this are the lack of prospects in the country and the American Parole humanitarian programme.
37 Haitian police officers were killed by criminals in 2023. The loss of police officers on the force has significantly reduced the effectiveness of the National Police Forces.
Doctors without borders (MSF) has pulled out of an emergency clinic in Port-au-Prince after a patient was pulled out of an ambulance and shot. Two MSF hospitals were previously closed in 2023, in Tabarre and Cite Soleil as a result of gang violence.

The rate of homicides and kidnappings in 2023 increased by 72% and 71% respectively since 2022, while rape cases increased by 49%, according to the UN report.
Situation on the Multinational Security Support (MSS)
The High Court Judge Chacha Mwita will decide on 26 January 2024 whether the MSS goes against the Kenyan constitutions.
The director general of the Haitian National Police (PNH), Frantz Elbé, met with Kenyan police and government officials during a visit to the country at the end of December intended to discuss technical details of the MSS.
A report was published by the Crisis Group on the challenges that the MSS will face once in Haiti. It included the potential for gangs to work together in fighting the Kenyan forces, enabling an attack on several fronts, if the intervention is deemed poorly equipped and trained.
Another challenge for the Kenyan-led troops would be to distinguish between gang members and civilians, while navigating parts of the cities under gang control. The inability to speak Haitian creole would also play a part in these issues.
The Crisis Group further identified that corruption within the Haitian Police Force, and collusion with gangs by police officials, could lead to leaks on the operation. Finally, the report outlines that the local population may not be welcoming a foreign intervention.
For the MSS to be successful, they would have to intimidate the gangs into cooperation, while working with reliable intel within the neighbourhoods, and placing the protection of civilians at the centre of the operation.
International situation
The former Haitian senator, John Joël Joseph, has been sentenced to life in prison in the US for taking part in the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Two others have already been sentenced regarding their role in the assassination."
"Haiti Situation Report 1, December 2023",https://www.eepa.be/?p=8064,"5.2 million Haitians are in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 4.3 million are facing acute food insecurity, said the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Haiti, Ulrika Richardson.
A report was published by the UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) together with the UN political mission in Haiti urging for the deployment of the MSS and for the UN Security Council to update the list of individuals and entities that are subject to UN sanctions.
The report outlined that the spread of gangs into rural areas has led to the destruction of agriculture and has forced 22,000 people to flee to urban areas. At least 45% of the population is suffering from acute malnutrition.
The most prominent gangs are members of a coalition entitled G-Pèp which has taken control of large territories of the country, including the National Highway #1 and crossing points to and from the northern regions, allowing illicit circulation of arms and drugs.
With the police unable to control and contain the gangs, self-defence groups have emerged to protect civilians living in gang controlled areas. The practices of these groups include lynching of (alleged) gang members.
The UN has estimated that in 2023 the gang violence in Haiti has led to 3,690 people being killed, 1,432 injured and 2,591 kidnapped.
Situation on the Multinational Security Support (MMS)
In October, the UN Security Council endorsed the Kenyan Multinational Security Support (MSS) Mission to Haiti, which is set to be deployed in February 2024 at the earliest.
The mission was requested by the Haitian Prime Minister, Ariel Henry, to address gangs that have been taking control of crucial structures in the country.
The mission will consist of 1000 police personnel deployed in Haiti and will be funded by the US and Canada.
The mission will be led by Kenya, but include personnel from other countries, namely Senegal, Burundi, Chile, Jamaica, Ecuador, Barbados and Seychelles.
The focus of the mission will be on training and equipping the local Haitian police force and guarding important structures, including the principal airport, hospitals and schools.
6 Representatives of the Democratic party in the US wrote a letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling on the administration to withdraw their support of the MSS and instead focus on limiting the gangs’ access to guns and ammunition, most of which are imported from the US.
The UN High Commissioner, Volker Türk, emphasised that the MSS must comply with international human rights norms and standards.
Regional situation
High officials of Caricom, the Caribbean Community, arrived in Haiti on Wednesday 6 December and held talks with officials from several relevant sectors in the country.
The proposal introduced by Caricom for getting Haiti out of the current crisis included an
18-month transition period within which Ariel Henry would have presidential powers.
The proposal has already been rejected by the Montana Accord under the reasoning that it only benefitted one party. The Montana Accord is an opposition group in Haiti.
The proposal also included the formation of a 7-member transition council, the formation of a government of national unity, the establishment of a body to control government actions, and a reform of the constitution.
The Association of Haitian Industries (ADIH) has warned that the lack of control on the Haitian side of the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic has led to a decline in production.
The lack of control has also resulted in smuggling and illegal activities which have led to annual revenue losses of up to 440 million US dollars.
On 28 November, the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic was opened by a group of people claiming to be traders and investors joined by armed men who took hold of the border point.
It is speculated that border control authorities of the Dominican Republic were accomplices in the forced opening of the border.
Similar events took place on the 8th of November, when the border was opened to traders and entrepreneurs to allow recovery of goods that were still blocked at the Dajabón binational market.
More than 400 Haitians crossed the border into the Dominican Republic illegally on Saturday 9 November through the Sierra de Bahoruco National Park. Most of the Haitians were captured by Authorities from the Dominican Republic.
International situation
The United States announced sanctions against Haitians fueling instability, all of which are gang leaders. The United Kingdom also sanctioned two former high officials in the administration of Jovenel Moïse.
One of the leaders of the coup of 2004, Guy Philippe, has returned to Haiti after serving time in prison in the US for money laundering.
Joseph Vincent, a Haitian-American citizen, pleaded guilty to conspiring to assassinate the Haitian President, Jovenel Moïse, who was killed in 2021. 10 others have also pleaded guilty for conspiring to assassinate Moïse.
Over 40 people have been arrested related to the assassination of Moïse. Out of the 5 judges that have been appointed for this case, 4 have stepped down for fear of being killed."
